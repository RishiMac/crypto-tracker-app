# crypto-tracker-app
This is a Crypto Tracker command line application that is meant to help Crypto enthusiasts and investers keep track of their crypto values and investments.

Users can add currencies they want to buy, update the amount, get rid of cryptocurrency, view all their investments at once, view information on any particular 
currency to make educated choices.

Both investments and the current values of those real-time investments are kept on a minutley basis although it can be done in seconds if I were to pay for API calls. 

This can help investers make informed decisions.

Next Steps:
Setup alerts with AWS SNS so users can be notified via SMS of especially high/low currencies that are based on 24 hour interval net percentage thresholds to help investors act fast.
